# SLGACloud

The SLGACloud package is an R package. It doesn't do that much really.  
It is essentially just meant to ease access to the TERN Landscapes COGs DataStore URLS while you are working in R, Without having to jump out to the website all the time to copy the required COGs URLs.  

It also has some functions for accessing the raster covariate stacks metadata and functions to access the COGS Datastore web pages.

It is still very much developmental and may or may not continue to exist

To install the package in R  
  
library(devtools)  
install_github("AusSoilsDSM/SLGACloud")

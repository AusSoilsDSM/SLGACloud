# SLGACloud

The SLGACloud package is an R package. It doesn't do that much really.  
It is essentially just meant to ease access to the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA) Cloud Optimised GeoTIFF (COG) DataStore URLs while you are working in R, without having to jump out to the website all the time to copy the required COGs URLs.  

It also has some functions for utilising the COGs in the 'terra' package and for accessing relevant SLGA websites.

It is still very much developmental and may or may not continue to exist

To install the package in R  
  
library(devtools)  
install_github("AusSoilsDSM/SLGACloud")
